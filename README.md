# NMF_HMM_Modeling
NMF audio modeling and the Viterbi algorithm in MATALB
1. MATLAB implementation of the NMF (Lee and Seung 1999) using K-L divergence and multiplicative rule for source separation tasks.<\br>
2. MATLAB implementation of the Viterbi algorithm to decode a finite-state hidden Markov model.
